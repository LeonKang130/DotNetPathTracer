# CS263 Course Project

This repository contains the progress reports for our UCSB 2025 Winter CS263 course project. For better organization, we put the code implementations in separate GitHub repositories as they are relatively independent of each other. Please refer to the links provided here and in the reports for more detail.

## Week 1

Modified implementation of smallpt in C# and F#:
